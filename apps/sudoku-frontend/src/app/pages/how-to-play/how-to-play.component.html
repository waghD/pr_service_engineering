    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>A sudoku puzzle (pronounced as three syllables soo-DOH-koo, or soo-doh-koo) is similar to a crossword puzzle, but
      instead of filling in blank cells with letters to make words, numbers are filled in so that each row, column and
      3x3
      box contain the numbers one through nine. Because each row, column and 3x3 box contains nine cells, each of the
      numbers one through nine will be used exactly once in each row, column or box. Although most sudoku puzzles use
      numbers, any set of nine characters or symbols can be used.</p>

    <p>A cell is the basic unit of a sudoku puzzle. Cells are the smallest boxes in a puzzle. In one cell, you can
      fit one number. A row is a grouping of nine cells, one
      cell high and nine cells wide shown by the nine yellow cells in Figure 1, and similarly a column is a set of cells
      one cell wide and nine cells high and illustrated by nine. A 3x3 box is a group of nine
      cells three cells wide and three cells high as shown in the left bottom corner in Figure 1. The nine 3x3 boxes
      in a sudoku puzzle are delineated by the bold lines.</p>
    <p>
      Sudoku is a game of logic and reasoning, so you shouldn’t have to guess. If you don’t know what number to put in a
      certain space, keep scanning the other areas of the grid until you seen an opportunity to place a number. But
      don’t try to “force” anything – Sudoku rewards patience, insights, and recognition of patterns, not blind luck or
      guessing.
    </p>
    <h1>Solving - Elimination</h1>
    <p>What do we mean by using “process of elimination” to play Sudoku? Here is an example. In this Sudoku grid (shown
      in Figure 2), the third upper horizontal row (circled in Blue) is missing only a few numbers: 1, 3, 4, and 7.
      One way to figure out which numbers can go in each space is to use “process of elimination” by checking to see
      which other numbers are already included within each square – since there can be no duplication of numbers 1-9
      within each square (or row or column).</p>

    <p>In this case, we can quickly notice that there are already number 1s in the top right and top center squares of
      the grid (with number 1s circled in red). This means that there is only one space remaining in the third upper row
      where a 1 could possibly go – circled in green. This is how the process of elimination works in Sudoku – you find
      out which spaces are available, which numbers are missing – and then deduce, based on the position of those
      numbers within the grid, which numbers fit into each space.

      Sudoku rules are relatively uncomplicated – but the game is infinitely varied, with millions of possible number
      combinations and a wide range of levels of difficulty. But it’s all based on the simple principles of using
      numbers 1-9, filling in the blank spaces based on deductive reasoning, and never repeating any numbers within each
      square, row or column.</p>
    <p>Of course there are much more advanced techniques and approaches for solving a Sudoko. But with this foundation
      you should be able to solve your first grids!</p>
    <h1>Diagonal Sudoku</h1>
    <p>A diagonal Sudoku follows the same rules as a classic Sudoku. However, the diagonals in the Sudoku field may
      contain the numbers 1-9 only once (see Figure 3).</p>

    <h1>Color Sudoku</h1>
    <p>A color Sudoku follows the same rules as a classic Sudoku. However, each color may contain the numbers 1-9 only
      once (see Figure 4).</p>

    <h1>Dia-Color Sudoku</h1>
    <p>A diagonal-color Sudoku follows combines the rules of a color sudoku and a diagonal sudoku. Therefore, each color
      may contain the numbers 1-9 only
      once and the diagonals may contain the numbers 1-9 only once (see Figure 5).</p>

    <h1>Region Sudoku</h1>
    <p>A color Sudoku follows the same rules as a classic Sudoku. However, each region may contain the numbers 1-9 only
      once (see Figure 6).</p>
